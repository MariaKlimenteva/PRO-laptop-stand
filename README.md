##### ORIGINALITY OF THE DEVICE
- ###### Analysis of existing analogues and formulation of distinctive features of the project:

There are analogues of our product. Most of them are made of plastic, sometimes aluminum or metal alloys. Unlike analogues, we chose plywood as the main material.

Stands made of wood also exist in commercial production, however, they are usually without fans and perform only one function - the correct position of the laptop with a slight tilt.

Our product is multifunctional: it serves as a stand, allowing you to keep the laptop screen at eye level and keep the laptop itself slightly above the table, and also actively cools the heating bottom part.
